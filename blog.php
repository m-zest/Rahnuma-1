                              <h3 class="awesome pa_wi">How to identify your why</h3>
                             <p> We were born in the world to do something. Each of us has a certain purpose. Finding
these purposes is life. The sooner we can find out the purpose of life, the sooner we
will find the meaning of our life. If you want to find out complete success, happinessand fulfilment, you must find out you're why. If you don't have any reason to improve
your life you don't know your purpose or why of your life. If you want to go the extra
mile, you will get tired very soon. But if you have why of your life, it will give you
the extra strength, extra courage, the extra foot you need, the extra time you need. You
why will keep you going. To find out your why or purpose, you have to ask some
questions to yourself.</p><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

<h4>● What excites you:- </h4>
<p> Ask yourself what excites you instead of what you want to do. Because if you don't
feel excited, energetic, motivated, soon your willpower will fade away. Then you can't
do the work passionately which will force you to leave it short. Like someone feels
excited about dancing, someone about singing etc. So take your time and raise a
question to yourself about the reason of your excitement.</p>


<h4>● Like whom you want to be:- </h4>
<p> We all have an icon like whom we want to be. It
could be Sachin Tendulkar for a cricket lover, or it could be Deepika Padukone
for someone who wants to become an actress etc. So choose an idol for your
life and follow the person's footsteps. This process will give you directions and
also give deep knowledge about why.</p>
<br>
<h4>● How do you want to see yourself at the age of 60:- </h4>
<p>It is an excellent exercise
to find out your why. Write down all the things you want to see when you will
be 60 years old. This list will work as fuel for yourself. To fulfil these wishes
one will be motivated and enthusiastic. Through this exercise, one will be
crystal clear about his why and make small steps toward them.</p>

<h4>● One sentence to explain your life:- </h4>
<p> Try to explain your life in one sentence,
why you exist in the world. It could be anything like someone wants to be a
teacher, someone wants to be a photographer, someone journalist etc. A small
sentence can motivate you on a large scale. To find out your why, explain
yourself in one sentence and always keep it in front of you.
As soon as you find out your purpose or why of your life, you can start earlier.
Purpose of life gives you clarity in life, keeps you focussed on your goals and also
makes you a better person. A life without purpose or why is like an aimless ship. So
find out why of your life and work hard to fulfil them.
"If you can't figure out your purpose, figure out your passion. For your passion will
lead you right into your purpose." BISHOP T. D. JAKES

                              <h3 class="awesome pa_wi">How to choose a career</h3>
                             <p> Career is very much important for everyone, especially for students. A perfect career
makes a student's life blooming. It gives fulfilment to their dreams and makes them
happy. India has a large percentage of youth in its whole population. So choosing anaccurate career is very much important for every student. One wrong decision can
make their lives horrible. So many students are suffering from depression because
they are not happy with their careers. They don't like their jobs. As they took the
wrong decision while choosing a career, they suffer whole lives. To choose a perfect
career, students must ask themselves some questions first. The questions are - </p><span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">

<h4><ol>
<li>What do people tell me I am good at?</li> 
<li> What do people ask me to teach them??</li>
<li> What I am willing to do for long hours?</li>
<li> What I think I am good for?</li>
<li> How can I make a change by doing these things?</li>
</ol> </h4>

<p>After answering the questions one student has a clear vision of passion. If someone
follows his passion he will be successful. If a person makes his passion career, he will
never feel that he had made a wrong decision and will enjoy working hard. After this
follow these steps.</p>

<h4>● Make a list of interesting things </h4>
<p>After the tenth or after twelve students faces a dilemma. They became confused
about their careers. The pressure of family, relatives, friends make them
worried about it more and more. If one makes a list of things in which the
student has an interest and also good at, it will help the student a lot. Answers
of the questions will give a clear vision of some choices that will be suitable for
the student's career.</p>

<h4>● Take a mentorship program</h4>
<p>After making the list, consult with a mentor who can guide one student
properly because a mentor has lots of experiences and knowledge to provide. A
mentorship program helps a student to go in the right direction.</p>

<h4>● Talk with the people who are in that field</h4>
<p>Nothing is more beneficial than asking doubts from the person who is handling a
particular business. One to one conversation with them makes the whole thing crystal
clear. Students can make their mind and go-ahead without any hesitation.</p>

<h4>● Talk with parents</h4>
<p>Parents play a great role in every student's career selection. They act as a support
system for their children mentally and financially. If parents don't support a student,
that student can't do anything appropriately. Every successful student has huge mental
support from their parents which makes their journey easier. So asks parents about the
decision of career at least once.</p>

<p><b> Following these steps, one can choose a suitable career for himself.
Without hard work and interest in a subject, nobody will be successful in life. If
someone follows his passion with hard work, dedication, consistency and convertpassion into a career, one day definitely he will achieve so many things in life. So the
selection of a career is very much important not only to become a successful person in
life but also to become a happy person with lots of peace of mind. </b></p>

                              <h3 class="awesome pa_wi">How to plan your daily schedule</h3>
                             <p> Every day is very much precious for us. Every new day gives us new opportunities. So
we should use our days effectively because if we waste one day of our lives, we can't
relive that day. For students, every single day is very much important. If students use
days appropriately, they can make their future bright. To use a day we must plan our
daily schedule or routine properly and for this, we can follow these steps - </p><span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">

<h4>● Make a to-do list:-</h4>
<p>The to-do list is one of the most powerful technics for
planning a day. Every successful person makes their whole day plan through a
to-do list. If one person makes a to-do list for the whole day, his working
efficiency of the day increases 20 to 25% and regular practice of making a to-
do list also decreases the stress levels. So a to-do list will give a clear vision of
the tasks of the whole day.</p>

 
<h4>● Write down the to-do list:-</h4>
<p> Our brain has lots of information on it. If we don't
write down our tasks we will forget it soon. Researchers have proven that if we
write down a task on paper rather than on a mobile phone, our brain gets more
signal and remind us again and again to complete those tasks. So always write
down tasks of a day on a notebook.</p>


<h4>● Plan your day before you sleep:-</h4>
<p>The best time to make a to-do list is before
going to bed. If you write down the tasks of the next day, you will feel relaxed
because you have a clear idea of what to do and when to do in the next day.
Schedule the whole time of the next day which will help you to manage more
time. Always be organised as much as possible. Try to read the to-do list at
least twice before going to sleep. This process will help your brain to recognise
the whole to-do list properly.</p>

<h4>● Find out the best time of the day:-</h4>
<p>You have to follow the routine at your
own convenience. If someone is more productive at night, then make the
scheduled night based and if someone is more productive in the morning, then
keep the routine day based. It will help a person to manage the day suitably.</p>
 
<h4>● Use the ABC system:-</h4>
<p> The ABC system is prioritising the tasks of a day
through A, B, C. A tasks stand for urgent and important tasks which need
immediate action. A task has the highest level of priority. No tasks become
urgent by one day, we make the tasks urgent by pending them for a long time.
B type tasks stand for our personal works and goals or daily works of our lives.
These tasks are the second most important works so these tasks have less
priority. C tasks stand for our hobbies and extra works.</p>

<h4>● Take breaks:-</h4>
<p>Scientists have proven that if we break down a task in smaller
groups, it will be easier to do rather than a long term work. Small breaks give
us time to relax and enjoy the task. As a result, the brain does not feel bored. A
long term work makes our brains impatient. We cannot concentrate fully. So
always keep breaks between works.</p>

                              <h3 class="awesome pa_wi">How to plan for short term and long term goals</h3>
                             <p> Setting goals is an important component of the career planning process. To have a
successful and satisfying career, one must be able to define their goals and devise a
strategy to achieve them. A blueprint that will take one from choosing a career path to
working and ultimately succeeding at it is called a career action plan. This career
action plan must have both long and short-term goals. It is imperative to include the
steps to take to reach each one, along with ways to get around barriers that might get
in the way.</p><span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">

<h4>1. Having specific goals-</h4>
<p>What actually does success mean? It depends from
people to people. Success to one person may mean becoming CEO of a
company while to another person it may mean getting home from work by 6
p.m. every day.</p>

<h4>2. The goals must be measurable-</h4>
 <p>Having a timeframe for achieving the goals
and a way to determine when you have reached them.</p>

<h4>3. One should not be negative-</h4>
<p> The goals should be such that one desperately
wants it rather than something he wants to avoid. It is much better to say, for
instance, "I want to improve my skills over the next four years so that I qualify
for a better job" than "I don't want to be stuck in this job for another four
years."</p>

<h4>4. Being realistic- </h4>
<p>The long-term goals must be compatible with the abilities and
skills one possesses. If one cannot sing or play an instrument and wants to win
a Grammy award, that will set them up for failure.</p>

<h4>5. The goals must be reachable within the time frame you have set-</h4>
<p>Breaking a long-term goal down into smaller goals will be helpful. It is better to take baby
steps than one big giant leap.</p>

<h4>6. Pairing each goal with an action. </h4>
<p>For instance, if one’s goal is to become a
writer then he can sign up for a writing class.</p>

<h4>7. Being flexible.</h4>
 <p>Not giving up when one encounters barriers that threaten him is
the most important key. Flexibility also means being willing to let go of goals
that are no longer meaningful and instead putting that energy into pursuing
other ones.</p>

                             <p> Though there are many valuable lessons that our parents teach us, we should not let
our learning stop with them. One can become a self-sufficient and mature adult that is
capable of handling anything life throws at you if they possess the necessary skills. If
one works on building critical thinking skills, basic everyday skills, and academic and
professional skills, they can develop the life skills necessary for independence. Some
ways one can develop the skills are- </p><span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">

<h4>1. Getting a mentor and being a mentor-</h4>
<p>A good mentor can help in avoiding
the challenges and face the roadblocks that come in the way. Mentors help in
guiding the way towards success and tell you how to approach further. They
are going to give you the real feedback and not something which one wants to
hear and hone the skills.</p>

<h4>2. Being ready for new challenges- </h4>
<p>One should not lose any opportunity in life.
If one sees an opportunity for a career in a particular skill but doesn’t have this,
he must go for pursuing the course in that skill in order to grab that
opportunity.</p>

<h4>3. Reading and looking for problems to solve – </h4>
<p>Reading not only horizontally
but also vertically should be enhanced. When one reads from different sources
from different fields, they develop the good habits which are necessary for
honing the skills.</p>

<h4>4. Finding learning opportunities internally-</h4>
<p> One must be able to find learning
opportunities internally within the organization be it a school or a college or
even an office. Try speaking with the mentors and teachers about the learning
opportunities available around.</p>

                              <h3 class="awesome pa_wi">How to develop problem solving skills?</h3>
                             <p> The greatness of Apple’s Steve Jobs – in the words of his colleagues – lay in the fact
that he was the greatest problem solver of his time. Therefore, it is no surprise that
many companies today are hunting for problem solvers. The most widely used and
effective five-step formulas for improving problem solving skills is called IDEAL:
Identify, Define, Examine, Act and Look.</p>
<p>Here is how one can make the most of the time at university to improve problem-solving skills... </p><span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">

<h4>1. IDENTIFY the problem</h4>
<p>In a nutshell, the definition of problem-solving skills is very simple: it is the ability to
identify the nature of a problem, deconstruct it (break it down) and develop an
effective set of actions to address the challenges related to it. Indeed, in some
challenging situations many students are overwhelmed with emotions and see just big
obstacles, barriers or trouble. However, great problem solvers try usually to identify
the very roots of the problematic situation – the nature of a particular problem whichcan be clearly distinguished, addressed and ultimately solved. It is not enough to say
that the situation is bad or out of control, as this is very abstract and unhelpful. It is
more important to clarify where those problems and challenges come from. The very
first step in developing the valuable skills of problem solving is to learn how to look
at every situation as an identifiable problem.</p>

<h4>2. DEFINE the main elements of the problem</h4>
<p>The next step in problem solving – and in learning problem-solving skills – is an
ability to break down the problem into small pieces, or smaller and more manageable
parts by defining the main elements of the problem. It is an essential step and a skill to
develop both psychologically and managerially. Instead of facing a giant, scary,
impossible-to-climb monster-mountain, one has to learn how to define smaller roads
among the hills and rocks. When one breaks down a big problem into smaller
elements, then you are no longer facing an impossible task, and can go about making
several very concrete steps to achieve the goal and solve the problem.</p>

<h4>3. EXAMINE possible solutions</h4>
<p>Finding possible solutions is a very tricky step in the problem-solving process, as on
the surface it looks like most of the work is already done and the ultimate goal is
close. In reality, students should not just look for simplistic ways to address the
elements of the problem. They should find the most effective ways and turn them into
an opportunity to make a strong success story.</p>

<h4>4. ACT on resolving the problem</h4>
<p>Developing a step-by-step execution plan and acting effectively and decisively is the
final touch in the problem-solving process. This is also an important skill as it doesn’t
matter how effectively students identify the problem, define its elements and examine
possible solutions; everything still boils down to the ability to perform concrete steps
to execute the action plan. Within this problem-solving formula students should also
master skills such as monitoring and evaluating the entire action implementation
process and – if it is a group undertaking – learn how to delegate certain parts of the
work to each other or to external stakeholders.</p>

<h4>5. LOOK for lessons to learn</h4>
<p>At the moment when the problem is solved, the students sit down with all their
problem-solving trees and action plans, either alone or together if it is a group project.
This is the moment to look back and see if there is a need to tune up the work that has
been completed. Especially valuable is taking the time to evaluate the entire processand formulating the lessons to be learned so the next problem-solving project will be
more effective and produce even more elegant solutions.</p>
